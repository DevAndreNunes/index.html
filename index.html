<p>My name is Andr√© Nunes I am a self taught front end web designer from Portugal. I am proficient in HTML,CSS, jQuery and Bootstrap.
My end goal is to be working from anywhere in the world and doing what i love wich is developing pages.
I went to university to study Journalism, but that didn't work out because i lost all the passion for the profession.
For the past 4 years i've been working on a Constuction Materials store called Alvaro Covelo e Pinto LDA as a salesman and budget maker for the store
At the same time i've been studying Front end Developing @ Udemy.com, that's where i've learned all my frameworks.
I guess I can thank my girlfriend the most for being super supportive in my career change, she supoported me all of the time and the bright in her eyes is all I need to keep up with my effort</p>
